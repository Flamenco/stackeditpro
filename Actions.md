# Folder And File Actions
Several folder and file actions are available from the *Folder Overview* and the *Actions Menu*.

## Auto Number Files
Add or recalculate numeric prefixes for all files in a folder.  Available on the *Folder Info* page.
Numbering allows files to be manually sorted.

If you want to move a file, give it a number of where you want it to be (e.g. 6 or 7.5) and then renumber the files again.

## Remove Numbering
You can also remove the numbering and revert back to alphabetical order using the `Remove Numbering` action.
