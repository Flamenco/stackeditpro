# Folder And File Actions
Several folder and file actions are available from the *Folder Overview* and the *Actions Menu*.

## Auto Number Files
Add or recalculate numeric prefixes for all files in a folder.  Available on the *Folder Info* page.
Numbering allows files to be manually sorted.

If you want to move a file, give it a number of where you want it to be (e.g. 6 or 7.5) and then renumber the files again.

## Remove Numbering
You can also remove the numbering and revert back to alphabetical order using the `Remove Numbering` action.

## Move
Move a file or folder using an autocomplete dropdown menu.
## Delete
Delete a file or folder.
## Rename
Rename a file or folder.
## New File
Creates a new file in the current folder.
## New Sibling File
Creates a new file next to the current file or folder.  The new file is opened in edit mode.
## Insert New File After
Creates a new file after the referenced file.  Numbering must be enabled for the folder.
## Download Folder (Zip File)
This action downloads the selected folder as a zip file, including all subfolders and files.  The name of the zip file will be the name of the folder.
