# Sharing Overview

> This feature is in Beta.  
> Stay tuned for details.

With `StackEditPro`, you can easily share a file, folder, or an entire workspace.  You do not need to create a workspace, or publish to an existing service.  StackEditPro has a dedicated site for you to display your documents.

> We currently only offer public read-only sharing.  Viewers of your shares do not need to login.  Your documents may be indexed by search engines, so make sure you consider all implications before publishing.

> Our sharing site has a theme picker for light and dark themes.  We feel that the viewer should choose the theme, not the publisher.
