# Source-Code-Documentation Extension

Document source code outside of your codebase and render it as beautiful HTML.

# Usage

To trigger the *Source Code Documentation Extension*, do one of the following:
* Create a `yml` code fence having the first line an string item named `sig:`.
* Create a `ts` code fence having the first item a comment of `//@doc`.

# Examples
## Single Method Documentation
```yml
sig: "repeatString(text: string, times: number): string[]"
desc: Repeats a string the specified number of times.
params:
 text: The string you want to repeat.
 times: How many times to repeat.
ret: The string concatenated the requested number of times
```

```yml

sig: "repeatString(text: string, times: number): string[]"
desc: Repeats a string the specified number of times.
params:
 text: The string you want to repeat.
 times: How many times to repeat.
ret: The string concatenated the requested number of times
```

> If the `sig` has colons with trailing spaces, make sure to use quotes around the value to conform with the 	`YAML` specification.  Alternatively , you can also use a multline string such as `sig: |` or `sig: >`.

We use `Typescript` notation to define the method signature.

## Interface Documentation
You can also generate Typescript interface documentation by including the special comment `//@doc` as the first line of the code fence.  Any single line comments preceding declared items will become descriptions.

```ts
//@doc
// This is an interface comment
interface Foo {
  // This is a property comment.
  myProperty: string
  // This is a function comment.
  myFunction(myParam:string[]): string
}
```

```ts

//@doc
// This is an interface comment
interface Foo {
  // This is a property comment.
  myProperty: string
  // This is a function comment.
  myFunction(myParam:string[]): string
}
```

# Other Features (Pending)
The documentation can be displayed in a variety of ways by using templates and/or custom CSS.

The documentation can be pushed into or extracted from the source code.
