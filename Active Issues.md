## Data Corruption
There is an ongoing data corruption when merging data between 3+ clients.  The core sync engine incorrectly senses that files need to be merged, and odd remnants appear. 

When a merge happens, we add a *Merge Conflict Report* document to your workspace to indicate what was merged and when it happened.  You can then view the history of your document if you need to fix it.

## Zendesk Publishing Not Implemented
